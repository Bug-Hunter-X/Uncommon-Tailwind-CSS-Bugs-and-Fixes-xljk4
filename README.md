# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Bugs and Fixes

This repository demonstrates some uncommon bugs that can occur when using Tailwind CSS and provides solutions for them.  The bugs are often subtle and can be tricky to debug.

## Bugs

- **Incorrect Class Names:** Typos or incorrect class names are a common source of errors.  Tailwind CSS is very strict about its class names.
- **Configuration Issues:** Problems with your `tailwind.config.js` file (or equivalent) can lead to unexpected behavior. Make sure your config file is correctly set up and that all necessary plugins are included.
- **Missing Directives:**  If you're not using the `@tailwind` directives in your CSS file correctly, your classes won't be applied.
- **Conflicting Styles:** Sometimes, styles from different sources might conflict with your Tailwind CSS classes. Using !important should be avoided and the specificity of selectors should be checked.

## Solutions

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to resolve these issues. The focus is on proper configuration, accurate class naming, and ensuring that the `@tailwind` directives are correctly placed and imported.
