// Ensure your tailwind.config.js is correctly configured and that the necessary plugins are installed.
// Verify your CSS file includes the @tailwind directives correctly:
/*
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
*/

//Double check for typos in your class names. Use your IDE's autocompletion to avoid them.

//If you have conflicting styles from other sources, try to resolve them by using more specific selectors or adjust the order of your CSS.

//Example of correct usage:
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p class="text-lg font-medium">This is some text.</p>
</div>
