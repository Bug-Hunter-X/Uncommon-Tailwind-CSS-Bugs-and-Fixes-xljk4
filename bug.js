```javascript
// ... your Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p class="text-lg font-medium">This is some text.</p>
</div>
```

This code might cause unexpected issues if you don't have the correct Tailwind directives in your CSS file or if your config file has issues.
